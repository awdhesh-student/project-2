	<p><h2>About muscle cars...</h2></p>
	<p>The definition of muscle car is subjective and frequently debated.Muscle cars often have many of the following characteristics.</p>

	<p>A large V8 engine in the most powerful configuration offered for a particular model
		Rear-wheel drive
		Being manufactured in the United States in the 1960s or early 1970s (The specific year range of 1964â€“1973 is sometimes used)
		A relatively lightweight two-door body (opinions vary as to whether high-performance full-size cars, compacts, and pony cars qualify as muscle cars, as it is sometimes claimed that only intermediate cars can be considered muscle cars)
		An affordable price
		<hr>
		Being designed for straight-line drag racing, while remaining street legal.
		High-power pony cars are sometimes considered muscle cars, however personal luxury cars are often too expensive to be considered muscle cars.
		<hr>
		Sports cars and sports sedans are not usually considered muscle cars, since they are 
		generally associated with circuit racing rather than drag racing.Muscle cars are an extension of the 
		hot rodding philosophy of taking a small car and putting a large-displacement engine in it, for the purpose of increased straight-line speed.
